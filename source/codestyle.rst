Codestyle guideline
===================================


VencoPy sticks to the codestyle conventions used in the department of energy system analysis at DLR mainly put forward 
by Benjamin Fuchs. We use PEP-8 with the exception of lowerCamelCase for variable and method names and UpperCamelCase 
for class objects.
